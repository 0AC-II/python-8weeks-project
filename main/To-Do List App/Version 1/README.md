# 📝 To-Do List App (V1)

##  Overview

The **To-Do List App (V1)** is a simple Python console application that allows users to **add**, **view**, and **manage** tasks. It is built entirely using Python basics such as **loops, lists, conditionals, and user input**.

This is the **first version (V1)**, it focuses on core functionality while keeping the code beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

## ⚙️ Features

* **Add a task** – Users can type in new tasks and save them in the list.
* **View tasks** – Displays all saved tasks with numbering.
* **Exit the app** – Gracefully ends the program when the user is done.
* **Handles invalid input** – Ensures the app doesn’t crash with wrong choices.

## How It Works

1. Run the program

2. Choose an option from the menu:

   ```
   1. Add a task
   2. View tasks
   3. Exit
   ```
3. Tasks are stored **temporarily in memory** (list). Once the app closes, tasks are lost.

---

## Code Structure

* **tasks = \[]** → List that stores all user-entered tasks.
* **while running:** → Keeps the app running until the user chooses "Exit".
* **if choice == "1":** → Adds a task.
* **elif choice == "2":** → Displays the current tasks.
* **elif choice == "3":** → Exits the app.
* **else:** → Handles invalid inputs.

##  Future Improvements (V2+ Ideas)

*  Mark tasks as completed.
*  Delete tasks.
*  Save tasks to a file (so they persist after closing).
*  Add due dates or priorities.
